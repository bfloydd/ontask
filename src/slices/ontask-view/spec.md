- Initial load will get a full list of files from strategy method returned file, sort them Z-A by filename (not path), scan through them until 10 tasks are found. Keep going through the files until 10 tasks are found, either hitting the end or continuing.
- Stop scanning when 10 are found. We do this for performance.
- Performance is #1, because its very slow on mobile if we just keep scanning files. 
- We don't need a full up-front count of tasks because it is too costly on performance.
- When Load More button is pressed, it loads 10 more, looking at the last file used for more in that file, then continuing down the list futher in Z-A order, looking for more tasks to add from those files. Each Load More should keep going through the files until 10 tasks are found, either hitting the end or continuing.
- Load More logic should track what file we're looking at.
- No task counts anywhere.
- In the button, don't bother with the ongoing count total shown.
- Rendering html of items in Load More should be the same as initial load.
- If "Checkbox Source" is streams in settings, then we need to check all files in streams, using that strategy.
- Use the strategy interface. 
- Streams Strategy should get all files from all streams.
