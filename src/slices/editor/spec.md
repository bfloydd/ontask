## On Task - Editor Status Bar
- This is displayed only when enabled in settings.
- Displayed at the bottom of every markdown pane.
- It will show the Top Task.
- Markdown text will not flow underneath of it, but stop at it.
- Editor Status Bar should not be relooking for top task, searching through files, etc. We could perhaps use in-memory to remember and catch the event when updating from ontaskview.
